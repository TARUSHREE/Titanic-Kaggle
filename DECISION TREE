DESCISION TREE

#machine learning to build decision trees(glass-box model) to do the heavy lifting for us.

#rpart same as aggregate ,equation, headed up by the variable of interest and followed by the variables
used for prediction.
# to predict a continuous variable, such as age, you may use method="anova"
#since here a one or a zero, so method="class" is appropriate
