GENDER â€“ CLASS MODEL

### Analysed sex attribute, found that majority of female were saved compared to male.
Hence set the test tuples with sex value='female' to survive and male to not survive.

#summary of Sex
summary(train$Sex)
#expand the proportion table command
prop.table(table(train$Sex,train$Survived))
# row-wise proportion
#proportions in the 1st dimension which stands for the rows (using '2' instead would give you column
proportions
prop.table(table(train$Sex,train$Survived),1)
#change submission
test$Survived <- 0
test$Survived[test$Sex == 'female'] <- 1
#submit 2
submit <- data.frame(PassengerId = test$PassengerId, Survived = test$Survived)


### Applied binning for fair attribute in the data set, divided it into equi-frequency bins and
analysed it.


summary(train$Age)
#on the basis of age divide as below 18 or abovetrain$Child <- 0
train$Child[train$Age < 18] <-1
#table with both gender and age to see the survival proportions for different subsets
#number of survivors for the different subsets
aggregate(Survived ~ Child + Sex,data=train, FUN=sum)
#total no. of ppl
aggregate(Survived ~ Child + Sex, data=train, FUN=length)
aggregate(Survived ~ Child + Sex, data=train, FUN=function(x){sum(x)/length(x)})
#class and fare taken into consideration
train$Fare2 <- '30+'
train$Fare2[train$Fare <30 & train$Fare >=20] <- '20-30'
train$Fare2[train$Fare <20 & train$Fare >= 10] <- '10-20'
train$Fare2[train$Fare < 10] <- '<10'
aggregate(Survived ~ Fare2 + Pclass + Sex,data=train, FUN=function(x){sum(x)/length(x)} )
test$Survived <- 0
test$Survived[test$Sex == 'female'] <- 1
test$Survived[test$Sex == 'female' &test$Pclass == 3 & test$Fare >= 20] <- 0
#submit3
submit <- data.frame(PassengerId = test$PassengerId, Survived = test$Survived)
