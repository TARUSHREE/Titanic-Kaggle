GENDER â€“ CLASS MODEL

### Analysed sex attribute, found that majority of female were saved compared to male.
Hence set the test tuples with sex value='female' to survive and male to not survive.

#summary of Sex
summary(train$Sex)
#expand the proportion table command
prop.table(table(train$Sex,train$Survived))
# row-wise proportion
#proportions in the 1st dimension which stands for the rows (using '2' instead would give you column
proportions
prop.table(table(train$Sex,train$Survived),1)
#change submission
test$Survived <- 0
test$Survived[test$Sex == 'female'] <- 1
#submit 2
submit <- data.frame(PassengerId = test$PassengerId, Survived = test$Survived)
